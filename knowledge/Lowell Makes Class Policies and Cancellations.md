**Lowell Makes Class Policies and Cancellations**

Providing educational opportunities is an integral part of the Lowell Makes mission, but it also requires a significant commitment from our volunteer team. In addition, our instructors spend time and resources planning for classes and anticipate that students will be prepared to attend as planned. All students are expected to be familiar with the class policies listed below. 

**Class Registration and Fees:**  There are two types of class registration tickets: member and non-member. Lowell Makes members may register for available classes as long as they meet all class prerequisites and pay the member rate. Non-members may only register for classes that are open to the general public. If there are material fees, it is expected that all students are prepared to pay this fee in cash, or another agreed upon manner, to the instructor at the beginning of the class. Failing to pay the materials fee may result in a ticket cancellation without refund. 

**Class Cancellation or Reschedule:**  Lowell Makes reserves the right to cancel or reschedule classes due to low enrollment, inclement weather, or other conditions beyond Lowell Makes’ control. We also reserve the right to change instructors or adjust the schedule. Every effort will be made to notify registered students of any changes *as soon as possible*. Class fees paid for classes that are canceled will be fully refunded. If the student is unable to attend the rescheduled class, the class fee will be refunded. 

**Class Withdrawal by Student:**  All tickets are non-refundable if the class is held as scheduled. If the student is unable to attend, the student may transfer their registration to another person who qualifies, provided the person is in the same ticket category. For example, member-only class registrations can only be transferred to other members. The person transferring the ticket should provide the email registration confirmation to the person accepting the transfer; this registration confirmation may be requested by the instructor. This is considered a private transaction; Lowell Makes holds no responsibility for transfers gone wrong and any refunds for cancellations/changes will be applied to the original ticket holder’s account.
