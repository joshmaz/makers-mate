**Lowell Makes:  Instructor Expectations**

* Understand the Instructor Payment process: The Instructor MUST submit a [W9](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-w-9)  with contact info to the Lowell Makes Bookeeper: [robyn@fayaccounting.com](mailto:robyn@fayaccounting.com).  EdCom submits Instructor invoices at the beginning of the ***next*** calendar month following the class.  From then, it can take 4 (and sometimes more) additional weeks for payment to be processed, approved and mailed.  Venmo is an option, if requested by the Instructor.    There may be further delay if W9 has not been submitted.  Contact EdCom with any questions or late payments:  [education@lowellmakes.com](mailto:education@lowellmakes.com)
