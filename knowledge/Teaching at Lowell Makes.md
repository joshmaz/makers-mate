**Teaching at Lowell Makes**

Lowell Makes is not just a place to make stuff; we’re a place to learn and connect.  If you are interested in teaching or hosting a class at LM this guide will assist you with the process.

All classes are supervised by a Sponsor; a Sponsor is a Shop Captain, Education Committee Member (EdCom) or a LM Committee Chair/Designee.  The Sponsor is responsible for coordinating, supporting, promoting and overseeing the class or event.  EdCom will assist with class logistics/support, pricing, entering the class into Nexudus Calendar, marketing, and advising the Sponsor, and/or Instructor.  Contact [education@lowellmakes.com](mailto:education@lowellmakes.com) with any questions/concerns.

**Instructors:**

**There are three ways to get started and find a Sponsor:**

1. Complete the [Instructor Interest](https://forms.gle/yCa1SvTo1bWuUcmG8) form.  EdCom will pair you with a “Sponsor”.  
2. Reach out to the Shop Captain where your class will take place with your idea for the class and confirm the Captain will Sponsor the class.
3. Reach out to the EdCom for support [education@lowellmakes.com](mailto:education@lowellmakes.com)

Your Sponsor will want to know a couple basic things about you and the class you are proposing; for example:

1. Are you knowledgeable and experienced in the area you will teach?  
2. Why is the class appropriate and relevant to LM and it’s mission?  
3. How do you know there is interest/support for the class?  
4. What resources will you need, and are they available at LM? If not, how will you obtain them and at what cost?  
5. How many sessions and how long will the class take?  
6. What, if any experience, knowledge or tools should the student have before registering?  
7. Are there any safety concerns?

**The Instructor and Sponsor will work together to:**

1. Determine Class Date(s):  Check with the EdCom about availability of space/resources (if using public space at LM) or the Shop Captain if using shop space. Please check the [calendar](https://lowellmakes.spaces.nexudus.com/en/events) to avoid conflicts.  Shops should make sure the class/event does not conflict with any other programs in their shops. Try to avoid scheduling classes on:  

* The first Saturday of the month (for parking reasons; evening classes are OK)  
* The first Tuesday evening of the month (member meetings)  
* Wednesday evenings during Open House  

2. Complete the [Class Proposal Form](https://forms.gle/763KNnpNZGe6FPoB6) (if this is a repeat class, reach out to Edcom to copy the previous event, changing dates/times \- instead of completing a new form).  Here are helpful tips in completing the form.

* Craft the class description to be engaging and informative.  The short description should be only 2-3 sentences.  The long description should be more detailed. Include any prerequisites and material fees for the class.
* Determine Class Fee(s):  The four components of the class fee:  
  * Percentage of fee provided to Lowell Makes (Required 20%)  
  * Percentage of fee provided to the Hosting Shop (Range 0-80%). Shop Captains who host classes/events in their own shops should consider allocating an appropriate percentage of class revenue for their shop.  This amount will vary, we have recommended a minimum 20% of the class revenue to go to the shop; this is to cover use of materials, equipment and to allow for shop growth; however, this is not required.
    * When classes use multiple shops, Shop Captains should negotiate the income split in advance.  
  * Percentage of fee provided to the Instructor (Range 0-80%) Sponsors and Instructors should negotiate Instructor payment in advance. Sponsors may want to set a standard percentage they offer to minimize negotiations..  
    * Instructor fee may be a percentage of income (recommended) or a set amount.  
    * Instructors may opt to donate their fees to the host shop, a different shop, or LM operating fund.  
  * Determine cost of materials and whether the material fee will be included with course fee, or an additional fee collected at the time of the class by the Instructor.
* Submit the Class Proposal Form at least 3 weeks prior to the class date.  This gives the EdCom time to review the form, upload to the calendar, social media, and for attendees to register.  
* Contact EdCom if there is a delay in posting [education@lowellmakes.com](mailto:education@lowellmakes.com)

3. Monitor Class Registration and if the class does not meet the minimum number of students contact [education@lowellmakes.com](mailto:education@lowellmakes.com) at least 36 hours prior to the start of the class to discuss options.
4. Review [Lowell Makes Class Policies and Cancellation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_537E5BouDoCdlKie2oprVc4keQZArQ02LxscTIT_tg/edit?usp=sharing)  
5. Review [Instructor Expectations](https://docs.google.com/document/d/144cEMoIOzahg16xem32PFtV5MvTYAmH6nmu3BODM6fI/edit)
6. Review Instructor Payment Process:   The Instructor MUST submit a [W9](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-w-9)  with contact info to the Lowell Makes Bookeeper: [robyn@fayaccounting.com](mailto:robyn@fayaccounting.com).  EdCom submits Instructor invoices at the beginning of the ***next*** calendar month following the class.  From then, it can take 4 (and sometimes more) additional weeks for payment to be processed, approved and mailed.  Venmo is an option, if requested by the Instructor.    There may be further delay if W9 has not been submitted.  Contact EdCom with any questions or late payments:  [education@lowellmakes.com](mailto:education@lowellmakes.com)

8. Debrief after the class, discussing what went well, and possible improvements for future classes.

**In addition, for Outside Instructors (Instructors who are not members)**

* The Sponsor must be present, or find another responsible member to be present, just before, during, and just after the workshop. Non-members cannot be in the space without a member “chaperone.”  
  * This member will aid the instructor in setup, check-in (opening doors, etc.), and clean up.

**Private Classes:**

* One-on-One classes are scheduled at the request of the student directly with the Instructor.
* Both the student and Instructor must be LM members.
* The Instructor handles the scheduling, pricing, materials etc.  If using a Shop/Shop resources, the Instructor must obtain approval from the Shop Captain.  The Shop Captain may negotiate some portion of the fee to cover expenses.  

**Ed Com:**

* Posts all classes and events to our member portal, Nexudus. The classes/events are visible both internally and externally.  This is where students register for classes/events.  
* Notifies the Marketing Committee of the class and posts public classes as an event on our Facebook account and on other social channels.  EdCom strongly encourages the Instructor and Sponsor to promote their classes as well.  
* Generates Class Revenue reports and submits Instructor Invoices to the Bookkeeper for payment during the first week of the month.
