# Makers Mate

**Makers Mate** is the Lowell Makes community‚Äôs custom GPT, designed to help members and volunteers quickly find information, follow processes, and learn how to use shops and tools safely.

üß† **Use it here:** [Makers Mate on ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-68f84628b8688191b2569ee7afaea16c-maker-s-mate)

## üéØ Purpose

This repository tracks everything that defines and feeds the Makers Mate GPT:

- The **instructions** used in the ChatGPT Builder  
- All **knowledge documents** uploaded to the GPT  
- The **catalog** that indexes where every official document lives  
- Contribution guides, governance info, and templates for consistent updates  

> **Scope:** Keep it simple and transparent.  
> **Future-friendly:** The structure can easily evolve to support a self-hosted or retrieval-based LLM later.

2. **Upload knowledge files**  
   - Place Markdown or PDF snapshots of official docs into `/knowledge`.  
   - Follow the [Ingestion Playbook](docs/ingestion_playbook.md) for clean formatting.

3. **Update the document catalog**  
   - Add or update rows in `/catalog/doc_index.csv` using the schema provided.  
   - Reference the [Catalog Playbook](docs/catalog_playbook.md) for workflow details.

## üï∏Ô∏è Document Ingestion & Indexing

Makers Mate does not browse the web; instead, content from official sources (like `lowellmakes.com` or `wiki.lowellmakes.com`) is **snapshotted** into `/knowledge` and recorded in the catalog.

Read these for how to do it:

- üìò [Website-to-Knowledge Ingestion Playbook](docs/ingestion_playbook.md)  
- üìó [Document Catalog Playbook](docs/catalog_playbook.md)

---

## üîÑ Versioning

- **CalVer + Minor:** `YYYY.MM.MINOR` (e.g., `2025.10.2`)  
- **Minor bump** = any instruction or content update that changes GPT behavior or adds major documents.

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for release notes.

## üß© Future Expansion

This repo anticipates growth into a self-hosted or retrieval-augmented environment.  
Potential future folders:

- `/tools/` ‚Äî plugin or connector definitions  
- `/scripts/` ‚Äî validation or ingestion helpers  
- `/infra/` ‚Äî deployment notes or LLM hosting configs
