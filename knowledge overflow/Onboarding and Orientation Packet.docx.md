**Getting Connected and Getting Involved**

We have an amazing collection of talented, intelligent, and creative members. The collective knowledge of this community is the best tool we offer. Here are ways of connecting with and joining our community. 

**Members Meeting**  
First Tuesday of every month, 7-8pm  
All members are invited, virtually or in person. Find out what’s happening at your makerspace\!

**Basecamp**  
We expect all LM members to be involved on Basecamp, our main method of communication between members. It is the best way to contact anyone at LM and keep up on everything happening at LM. Once you’re invited by a member, Basecamp is available as an App and website.

* **Teams and Projects \-** Individual communities for shops, committees, or areas of interest. Each Team or Project has the following subsections:  
  * **Campfire \-** a discussion section with a feed where new posts appear in real time.   
  * **Message Board \-** Announcements, updates, and topics that involve longer discussions.   
  * **Docs and Files \-** Pinned documents and files relevant to the Team. These can include Checkout paperwork, rules, contact information, or other crucial documents.  
* **Pings \-** Direct Message another member of LM. It is the best and fastest way to get a question answered by a Captain, Committee Chair, or another member.  
* **Opportunities \-** You can find job opportunities, stuff for sale, discounts at local businesses for LM members, and volunteer opportunities both around the space and out in Lowell. Check out **Member Market and Swap** and **Commissions and Job Requests** as a way to get started.

**Basecamp is not like other social media\!**  Basecamp is the online extension of our physical space. You will have real-life interactions with the Lowell Makes members who read your posts on a Message Board or in Campfire. Keep your posts (and your private pings) civil and constructive. Avoid sarcasm as it does not translate well. Please bear in mind that Lowell Makes has policies in place requiring members to treat each other with kindness and respect in all venues..**\**Please* *think before you post***\*

**Nexudus, our Member Portal is where you signed up for your tour and membership.**  You can find and register for upcoming classes and events, update your membership plan, and change your personal information as well. Going to members.lowellmakes.com will redirect you to our Nexudus site.

**Policies**  
These policies are integral to the functioning of LM as a community. ExCom may change or adjust these policies as needed; stay up to date by checking basecamp or the digital versions of this document.

**Clean up after yourself –** All members are expected to clean up after they work. This means sweeping, dusting, or wiping down the areas and tools you used, returning tools to their proper place, and resetting any adjustments you have made to a tool.

**Report anything broken \-** Broken shop equipment must be reported to shop captains. Report building issues (leaks, clogged toilets, etc.) to Operations. 

**Incident reporting \-** Safety issues or injuries must be reported by submitting a Safety Incident & Injury Report form (located in Basecamp \> Town Square \> Docs & Files \> Surveys and Forms folder).

**Respect other people's projects –** Don't damage, use, or otherwise disturb other people's projects. If you do move a project, do so carefully and alert the owner of its new location. 

**Keep the doors closed –** Do not leave doors unlocked or propped open when unattended. 

**Scan your fob when you enter \-** Even if the doors are held open for you, please scan your key fob before you enter. This helps us with occupancy data and safety.

**All tools stay on site \-** No tools may leave Lowell Makes for any reason.

**Adhere to all posted signs \-** sometimes policies, guidelines, or checkout rules change. All of these changes will be made clear in signs posted around the space. All members are expected to follow directions given on posted signs. 

**Guests \-** Non-member guests are permitted at LM so long as they do not use LM equipment or interfere with other members. Guests and their actions are the sole responsibility of the host member.

**Respect our Neighbors \-** Be respectful of our neighbors at Western Ave Studios and Navigation Brewing. We share a parking lot, loading dock and elevator with them.

**Follow all shop rules –** Each of our shops is run a little differently. Please familiarize yourself with shop rules and expectations before use. Follow the Code of Conduct

**Logistics**

**Parking \-** Parking is allowed anywhere in the LM lot with the exception of a few marked spaces. Parking on the street is allowed until 10pm. To avoid being towed on the street, move your car to the lot before 10pm.   
We will reach out via email and Basecamp when there are further parking restrictions due to weather or events. Snow plowing will also be noted in Basecamp, as it requires that all vehicles be moved to the upper lot so the plows can get through (see Map at the end of this document).

**Bathrooms and kitchen \-** Keep bathrooms and kitchen clean. All food must be labeled with name and date. Do not take food that is not explicitly made available. 

**Garbage and recycling \-** Our dumpster is located inside the loading bay (black dumpster). Garbage cans from all shops and common spaces should be emptied into the dumpster. NO PERSONAL DUMPING\! And no items outside the dumpster. Place a new trash bag in the garbage cans.

**Store \-** The LM store is provided as a courtesy to LM members. It provides food, drinks, and some workshop materials. All items must be paid for, and should be rung up through the kiosk.  

**Video Recording \-** All shops and public spaces at LM are video recorded for security purposes. Assume that if you are at LM, you are on camera\! Per MA law, we do not voice record.

**Donations \-** As a nonprofit organization, donations to LM may be tax deductible by requesting a letter from LM. Shop material and/or equipment donations should not be left in a shop without approval from the relevant Shop Captain. Membership fees are not tax deductible.
