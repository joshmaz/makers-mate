Thanks for helping improve Makers Mate!

## How to Propose Changes
1. Create a new branch.
2. Edit `/gpt/instructions.md` or add/update files under `/knowledge` or `/docs`.
3. Run a quick self-check: does this change alter policy or just clarify wording?
4. Open a Pull Request and summarize:
   - What changed
   - Why it helps
   - Any affected shops or roles
5. Request review from at least **one** Shop Captain or ExCom member for governance/policy changes.

## What Belongs Here
- Public-facing documents intended for members.
- The canonical **instructions** for the custom GPT.
- Checklists, SOPs, and safety guidance approved by responsible captains.

## What Does *Not* Belong
- Sensitive member data or internal PII.
- Drafts that haven't been approved by the responsible shop leadership (mark drafts as such if included).
